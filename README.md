# Analyzing Transaction Graphs for Price Prediction of Bitcoin

This repository contains the code and datasets for a project focused on predicting the trend and price of the bitcoin market using machine learning and statistical analysis tools.

## Project Overview
The crypto market is highly volatile and is rapidly affected by news flow and politics, making it a challenging domain for prediction tasks. This project aims to develop comprehensive and highly accurate prediction models to predict the trend of the bitcoin market and its price.

The project utilizes historical transaction data, covering the years 2010 to 2015 on a monthly basis and 03-2011 to 09-2013 on a weekly basis, to develop and train the prediction models. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures were used for the sequential data analysis.

The project also explores the use of transaction graphs in price prediction, as many characteristic features of graphs can be obtained as a single output.
